QUICK START : G++
-------------------

To see an example of a ga in action:

make -f Makefile.MG happyfaces && ./happy_faces_opt

(fitness is based on number of moves to complete puzzle, anything 25
or higher is a completed puzzle, the higher the fitness, the faster
the chromosome completed the puzzle)

To see an example result from the ga (and to see the puzzle in action):

make -f Makefile.MG happysolution && ./happy_faces_solution

To see a suite of ga examples:

make -f Makefile.MG fast && ./gat7o

and see the main.cpp file to see how to use it.

Poor ducomentation is a known issue.

Tested on Ubuntu / Gcc 4.x
Untested on other platforms
