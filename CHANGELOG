GAtemplates CHANGELOG

v0.9
 * Added standards support to compile under G++ 4

v0.8a
 * Added mutation operator to chromosome

v0.8
 * Added binary search to SUS using three versions:
	- recursive: very very slow
	- non-recursive: slow dur to copying vector
	- pointers non-recursive: slightly slower than linear search
 * Added attempt at linear search using a hash table of map but solution
	is much slower than binary or linear search.
 * SM_USER1 causes X to crash on large populations 
 * reorganised main.cpp testsuite into chromosome and population test
        where population tests include timing information

v0.7
 * Fixed random number check rand_less that over-estimated random selection 
        due to overflow
 * Added mutation to run_once_rank children
 * Have a fully implemented testhappyfaces code and solution checker

v0.6b
 * Added crossover function passing

v0.6a

 * Added GAhappyfaces test to show a more complex fitness function.
 * Added placeholders for crossover_base and mutate_base to allow chromosome operations to be overwritten.
 * Added SM_TOURNAMENT selection (pick 2 random chromosomes, return the fittest)

-------------
v0.7 bug fix:

15-Apr-2004: Segfault occurs in sort() in population.run_once()
             The sort algorithm does a < comparison on two chromosomes
	     one of which is invalid and has null function pointers.
	     This problem only occurs when optimisation is on during
             compilation (-O3)
	     Problem only manifests itself in main NOT happy_faces
-----------: Could use Random Number Generator
             from stl instead of rand()
10-May-2004: Segfault in GAchromosome occuring because _crossfunc()
             is set to a NULL pointer. This should not happen...
	     It's a problem with the selection method... It only
	     happens when I use SM_USER0 or SM_USER1 - the faster
             SUS methods. Looks like I was indexing one past the
	     _population[] array. Stupid me.
